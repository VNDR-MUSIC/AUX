          <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground">
            The traditional music industry was built for major labels, not independent artists. It's often slow, confusing, and unfair. VNDR was created to change that. We are an autonomous music ecosystem designed to give independent artists the power, tools, and transparency of a major label, without the restrictive contracts. Our goal is to put artists in control of their careers and their earnings.

                This is your personal catalog management hub. When you upload a new work, you provide the audio file and basic details. Our platform then begins an autonomous enrichment process. This includes analyzing the audio for features like key and BPM, identifying potential collaborators, and preparing it for publishing. You can track the status of each work, view its analytics, and manage its details from this page.

                The Licensing Center is a two-way portal. Music supervisors and creators can come here to formally request a license to use a track in their project (e.g., a film, game, or advertisement). For artists, this is where you receive and manage those incoming requests. You can review the proposed use, and approve or reject the request.

It's where they can claim their daily token rewards and access key features. For administrators, the dashboard is a platform management tool, allowing them to view all works on the platform, manage subsidiary integrations, and oversee the health of the entire ecosystem.
